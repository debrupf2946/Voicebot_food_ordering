# Voicebot_food_ordering
### This is a _AI_ bot that **orders food** using _voice recognition_ 
by running app1.py the bot will ask for Food Items, quantity
by voice command, the customer can delete and modify the order
after conformation, the bot shows the final bill

python libraries that I used
1. PyAudio
2. theFuzz
3. Pandas
4. wave
5. HuggingFace(Open AI whisper model)

-Upcoming additions to the project(currently in process)       
-Using NER for getting food and quantity directly from the order statement       
-Storing the voice recordings of customers (connecting to MongoDB), for further training and increasing the accuracy of the bot
